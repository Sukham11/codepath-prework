i want to create a parking app that will help everyone in this world to find
parking spot at anywhere in the whole world. as I’m student studying at university.
it is really hard sometime to find parking at my university. sometimes it took me
10 15 min to find a parking spot. it got very irritated especially when I’m running
late. so, i decided to make an app that will help me and others in finding a
parking spot, so that no one has to feel the same way. i will implement features
like you can search parking at any place, can see how many spots are open and where
they are exactly and what is the best way to go there. my app will have a feature
of reserving a spot in parking. my app will also show different zones of parking in
different color because sometimes some zones are reserved for some special people.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
for the prework, i faced challange o finding different things on xcode because it
is first time i'm using it especially when writing code for changing color. also,
linking it to github through git desktop. i did use github before in school but not
git desktop.
